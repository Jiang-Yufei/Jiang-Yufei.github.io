Due to the good maneuverability of the drone swarm, it shows high efficiency in the exploration of unknown environment, which can be applied in domains such as disaster relief and forest exploration. The method can allocate exploration regions to individual drones, while considering the uneven distribution of obstacles and calculating the local environmental complexity to adjust the exploration cost. All the code has been open-sourced at `https://github.com/Jiang-Yufei/Multi-agent-exploration.git`
