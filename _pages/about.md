Hello! I'm Yufei Jiang. I am currently a Ph.D. student in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at Penn State University, with a research focus on aerial robotics.

Research Interest
======
My interests span a wide range of areas, including path planning, state estimation, perception, learning-based method, etc. I am particularly interested in enabling robots to become truly practical and transformative in improving people's daily lives. Beyond aerial robots, I also have a keen interest in hardware design and aspire to create innovative and versatile robotic systems.

In the future, I aim to explore advanced algorithms and robust hardware that can make robots not only intelligent and adaptive but also accessible and reliable in real-world applications. I am driven by the vision of pushing the boundaries of robotics to solve pressing societal challenges and looking forward to seeing a future where robots seamlessly integrate into and enhance human lives.
